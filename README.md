The vast majority of my projects are free software (free as in freedom), released under the GNU Affero General Public License. **If you use any of my code in your project, you must make your entire project's source code publicly available under the same license.** This applies whether you modify my code or use it as it is in your own project. This ensures that all modifications and derivative works remain free software, so that everyone can benefit.

If you are hosting your source code on a platform like GitHub or GitLab, to comply with the AGPL-3.0 license, you simply need to:

- **Make the repository public.**
- **Include the full text of the license with your source code.**
- **Ensure your source files contain a copyright and license notice.**
- **If users interact with your software over a network, provide a clear way for them to obtain the source code.**

If you are not willing to comply with these terms, you must refrain from using any of my code.

For full license terms and conditions, you can read the AGPL-3.0 at [**gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html**](https://gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html).
